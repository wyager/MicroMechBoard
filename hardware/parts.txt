Here's what I ordered to make 3x boards. Only 2/3rds of this is needed to make a whole 66-key keyboard. In some cases, I bought some extra parts (the MIN# is higher than it needs to be) because I thought I might break some parts. Using a 75 ohm resistor for the blue LED was a mistake. I should have used 150 ohm like with the other LEDs. The blue LED is much brighter, even with its supposedly much higher voltage drop.

***Digikey and others have these too

TRRS 3.5mm audio cable					1		1
***BE CAREFUL! Some of these are built wrong. I had to re-wire the first one I bought.
***A proper TRRS cable should be symmetrical (tip goes to tip, sleeve goes to sleeve, etc)
***but some appear to be built incorrectly.
